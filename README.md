# Minut home assignment - Recipe backend

A small toy backend built for browsing, adding & removing recipes. Intended for
use in home assignments. Recipes are stored in a simple local json database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [nodejs][] and [npm][] installed.

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the backend:

```
npm start
```

The backend will be serving requests from [localhost][], port 3000. You can
visit [this link][getrecipes] in your browser to verify that it is up and
running correctly.

[localhost]: http://localhost:3000
[getrecipes]: http://localhost:3000/recipes

## Endpoints

These are the available endpoints

1. `GET localhost:3000/recipes`
   - Returns the list of stored recipes
2. `POST localhost:3000/recipes`
   - Store a recipe in the backend
3. `GET localhost:3000/recipes/:id`
   - Retrieve a specific recipe
4. `PUT localhost:3000/recipes/:id`
   - Update a specific recipe
5. `DELETE localhost:3000/recipes/:id`
   - Delete a recipe
6. `GET localhost:3000/reset`
   - Development endpoint to reset the database to its original state

You can find them defined in `endpoints.js`.

## Recipe

This is the shape of a recipe:

```typescript
interface Recipe {
  title: string; // recipe title; REQUIRED
  description: string; // short description of the recipe; REQUIRED
  ingredients: string[]; // an array of strings for listing ingredients; REQUIRED
  instructions: string; // instructions on how to prepare the food; REQUIRED
  imageUrl?: string; // an URL to an image for the recipe; OPTIONAL
  sourceUrl?: string; // an URL to the original recipe; OPTIONAL
}
```

When creating new recipes by sending PATCH requests, the request body will be
validated according to this model.

Sample recipes and and the schema validator can be found in `recipes.js`.

## Database

The recipes are stored locally in `recipe-db.json`. If you want to reset the
database to its original state use the `reset` endpoint above or visit
[this link](http://localhost:3000/reset) when the backend is running.
